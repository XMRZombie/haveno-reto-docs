Trading needs an account for the payment method and currency used to take and publish offers, it also ensure data integrity and protects against evil actors trying to use stolen accounts.

### 3. Trading

### 3.1 Create, fund and publish your offer (maker)

Go in the market you want to trade (in our example selling Monero for Bitcoin) and click on `CREATE OFFER TO SELL XMR`
![Image](../resources/img/haveno-ui/create_offer.png)

You can set an optional minimum of XMR to buy, if you want flexible sizes to be accessible and setting a fixed price or a % derivation (below or above the market price) before clicking on `NEXT STEP`.

After the offer is set, you need to fund your trade offer with a security deposit worth 15% of the trade (as shown earlier) before placing your offer.
In our case since we sell we technically need 115% of the trade.

It is generally advised to externally fund your trade so you'll need to wait for block confirmations, balance is shown as **pending** until the external deposit reached 10 block confirmations and you will have the possibility to click on `REVIEW: PLACE OFFER TO BUY BTC` when funds will be shown in **available balance**.

Confirm placing your offer, you can take your TradeID to share it privately to someone or reviewing the summary before confirming.

Now the offer is published, you can disable it if you wont be available or for activating it to people you know only.

In our example the taker buy XMR so marking `PAYMENT SENT` once BTC funds are sent to the maker.

The maker clicks on confirm receiving the payment after having verified it.
