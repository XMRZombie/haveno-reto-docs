# Trading recommendations (the best ways to trade)

### Maker recommendations

- Use min/max tradeable amounts on your offer if you want to let people picking custom amounts.
- Hold your cursor on daily/weekly/monthly traded candle charts to get a median/average price for pricing your offers with fixed rates.
- Stay online when sending/receiving payment notifications (payment sent or received)

### Taker recommendations

- Use the filter feature in buy/sell offers to find a specific offer (with the TradeID) or peer (with the hidden-service.onion:9999).
- Fund externally your trade when taking offers if you want to be sure you have right amounts to trade.
- Stay online when sending/receiving payment notifications (payment sent or received)

  ## Trust and reputation

In haveno-reto, there's no official "star/score" rating. But why ?
- There's no way to prove if a feedback was real or not.
- Security deposits enables financial stake on a trade to incentivize honest actors.

What could I personaly use to create a kind of scoring ?
- When recurently trading with specific peers, you'll get the trade count on the profile logo. So taking offers and build P2P reputation from trading count is probably the best way.
- The account info for finding aged accounts to trade with experienced traders.

What if something goes wrong, even with these personal score metrics ?
- [Open a dispute](../the-project/conflict-resolution.md) and the arbitration will do it's work.
